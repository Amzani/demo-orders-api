definitions:
  hal-link-object:
    title: HAL Link Object
    description: A Link Object represents a hyperlink from the containing resource to a URI.
    type: object
    required:
      - href
    properties:
      href:
        description: |
          Its value is either a URI [RFC3986] or a URI Template [RFC6570]. If the value is a URI Template then 
          the Link Object SHOULD have a "templated" attribute whose value is true.
        type: string
      templated:
        description: | 
          Its value is boolean and SHOULD be true when the Link Object's "href" property is a URI Template. 
          Its value SHOULD be considered false if it is undefined or any other value than true.
        type: boolean
      type:
        description: |
          Its value is a string used as a hint to indicate the media type expected when dereferencing the target resource.
        type: string
      deprecation:
        description: |
          Its presence indicates that the link is to be deprecated (i.e. removed) at a future date. 
          Its value is a URL that SHOULD provide further information about the deprecation. A client SHOULD provide some 
          notification (for example, by logging a warning message) whenever it traverses over a link that has this property. 
          The notification SHOULD include the deprecation property''s value so that a client maintainer can easily 
          find information about the deprecation.
        type: string
      name:
        description: |
          Its value MAY be used as a secondary key for selecting Link Objects which share the same relation type.
        type: string
      profile:
        description: |
          Its value is a string which is a URI that hints about the profile [RFC6906] of the target resource.
        type: string
      title:
        description: |
          Its value is a string and is intended for labelling the link with a human-readable identifier (as defined by [RFC5988]).
        type: string
      hreflang:
        description: |
          Its value is a string and is intended for indicating the language of the target resource (as defined by [RFC5988]).
        type: string

  hal-curies-link:
    title: HAL Curies Link
    description: | 
      Custom link relation types (Extension Relation Types in [RFC5988]) SHOULD be URIs that when dereferenced in a web browser 
      provide relevant documentation, in the form of an HTML page, about the meaning and/or behaviour of the target Resource. 
      This will improve the discoverability of the API. The CURIE Syntax [W3C.NOTE-curie-20101216] MAY be used for brevity for these URIs. 
      CURIEs are established within a HAL document via a set of Link Objects with the relation type "curies" on the root Resource Object. 
      These links contain a URI Template with the token ''rel'', and are named via the "name" property.'
    allOf:
      - type: object
        properties:
          templated:
            enum:
              - true
        required:
          - templated
      - $ref: '#/definitions/hal-link-object'

  hal-resource:
    title: HAL Resource Object
    description: |
      'A Resource Object represents a resource. It has two reserved properties: (1) `_links` which contain links to other resources,'
      'and (2) `_embedded` which contain embedded resources. All other properties MUST be valid JSON and represent the current state of the resource.'
    type: object
    properties:
      _links:
        description: |
          It is an object whose property names are link relation types (as defined by [RFC5988]) and values are either 
          a Link Object or an array of Link Objects.  The subject resource of these links is the Resource Object of which
          the containing "_links" object is a property.

          or an array of Resource Objects. Embedded Resources MAY be a full, partial,
          or inconsistent version of the representation served from the target URI.
